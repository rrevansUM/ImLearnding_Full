# Ralph Wiggum

First, why Ralph Wiggum? and Why "Learnding"? Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKg2ZzPKl2M). If you don't get it then stop reading.

# Why?

This blog is an attempt to (re-)learn some of the maths involved in the wealth of statistics. These are things I've either forgotten about from graduate school or never paid attention to. I am doing this in collaboration with a colleague, Tony Van (or TV for short), and possibly others if they're interested. The idea is to blog about theory, application, and exercises in the course of our book learning, leveraging the power of R to help solve problems or explain/demonstrate concepts.

We'd like to tackle matrix algebra, statistics specific calc material, and numerical methods.
